<p><b>An iFrame, also knowns as Inline Frame, is an element that loads another HTML element inside of a web page. They are commonly used to embed specific content like external ads, videos, tags, or other interactive elements into the page.

So, you may be wondering how it’s done. Chances are the web designer put an iFrame element within that page.

<li><u><b>How to Use iFrame</b></u></li></OL></font><font face="lato" color=brown size="4"><b>
<p>You shouldn’t use iFrame excessively. It can slow down your page and pose a security risk, especially if you use content from a suspicious website.
 Think about an iFrame as a part of your content, but not part of your site. For example, if you want to add a YouTube video to stimulate your readers, then you can insert an iFrame element to that post.</P>
<font face="lato" color="brown" size="4" align=left> <p><b>Now you know that iFrame is an additional element to share content from other sites. You can add it to give context about a certain topic to the readers. 
You can insert an iFrame element by using the &lt iframe &gt tag in an HTML document. Copy the code below and paste it to notepad, and save the file as .html format:</b></p></font>

<font face="lato" color=brown size="3" align="left"><li>The &ltiframe&gt…&lt/iframe&gt tag is used to contain the video within the iFrame.</li><br>
<li>The iFrame source (src) is the origin of the content from the external or internal server. Don’t forget to put the embedded code in the URL.</li><br>
<li>Width and height is the aspect ratio of the iFrame. You can insert a fixed sizes such as 680×480 pixels (px) as in the example. Or, you can use a percentage (10%-100%) based method to adjust the iFrame automatically.</li></ul>

<ol start="2"><li><u><b>Security Threats of Using iFrame</b></u></li></ol></font><font face="lato" color=brown size="4" align="left"><p>By nature, the iFrame element does not pose any security risk for your web page or your readers. Partly, it was developed to help content makers add 
visually engaging material to the readers. Nevertheless, you need to pay attention when adding an iFrame from an untrusted site website.There was a surge of iFrame code injection on some legitimate websites, such as ABC news, in 2008. 
This type of attack redirects visitors to a malicious site, which will then install a virus to the visitors’ PC or attempt to steal sensitive information. That is why it is not recommended to include iFrame as an integral part of your 
website.If you think that a website is not safe, don’t even bother to link it and don’t put its content in your iFrame element.</P></font>

<ol start="3"><li><u><b>Conclusion</b></u></li></ol></font><font face="lato" color=brown size="4" align="left"><p>All in all, iFrame is a powerful element if you want more engagement for your visitors. Think of iFrame as part of the
 content that you make, not as an integral part of your website. You shouldn’t use iFrame excessively though; it is better if you can develop your site without iFrame. If you still need to use it for development purposes, remember only
 to use content from a trustworthy site. We hope that this article helps you on implementing and understanding iFrame.</P></font><br><hr>
